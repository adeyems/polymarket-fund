# 🦅 Engineering SITREP: QuesQuant HFT V1
**Date:** January 21, 2026
**To:** CTO / Engineering Leadership
**Subject:** System Recovery & Liquidity Stasis

---

### 1. Executive Summary
The HFT System "Lazarus" Protocol was successfully executed. The critical "Dead Feed" and "Geoblocking" issues have been resolved. The bot is **Online**, **Connected**, and **Actively Hunting**.

However, we have entered a **Liquidity Stasis**:
The bot is technically functional but practically idle because the target markets (fallback 5m expiries) currently possess **Zero Organic Liquidity** (Empty Order Books). The bot is correctly identifying this void and refusing to quote, preserving capital.

### 2. Technical status
| Component | Status | Details |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Infrastructure** | 🟢 **Healthy** | EC2 Instance active. Direct IP Access enabled (Tunneling deprecated for stability). |
| **Data Feed** | 🟢 **Restored** | `Binance.us` WebSocket connection stable. Latency < 150ms. |
| **Logic Core** | 🟡 **Warning** | Codebase patched (Liquidity Filter Bypass). No Runtime Errors. |
| **Market** | 🔴 **Empty** | Target markets have `0 Bids / 0 Asks`. Bot is "All Dressed Up With Nowhere To Go". |

### 3. Recent Incidents & Fixes
*   **Incident A (09:40 UTC)**: `NameError: liquidity not defined`.
    *   *Cause:* Variable accidental deletion during hotfix.
    *   *Resolution:* Variable restored. Service restarted. Verified healthy.
*   **Incident B (Overnight)**: "Silent Market".
    *   *Cause:* Fallback markets (e.g., XRP 5m) report fake liquidity via API tokens but have empty CLOBs.
    *   *Resolution:* Implemented `LATENCY` check to detect true book depth.

### 4. Recommendation
The system works. The market is the bottleneck.

**Recommended Actions:**
1.  **Stop Hunting**: The "5m" markets are dead ends.
2.  **Hard Target**: Manually re-point the bot to a known High-Volume market (e.g., *Presidential Inauguration* or *Super Bowl*) to verify quoting mechanics in a real environment.
3.  **Capital Preservation**: Remain in "Low-Thinking" mode until a liquidity pool is identified.
