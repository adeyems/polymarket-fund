    "VOLUME_SURGE strategy buys at prices in the empirical death zone (0.035-0.45 range) — 13.6% win rate, -$242 P&L on 22 trades. Strategy logic fundamentally flawed against Becker dataset intelligence.",
    "DIP_BUY recovered from -$46 to +$13 between 17:13 and 22:17 UTC on 2026-02-20, showing resilience. Final stats: 41 trades, 36.6% WR, +$13.11.",
    "MARKET_MAKER is the dominant profit engine: 90 trades, 96.7% WR, +$1,078.92 P&L. Nearly 2x initial capital on its own.",
    "NEAR_CERTAIN, NEAR_ZERO, NEG_RISK_ARB are idle/waiting — no trades placed in current simulation cycle. Capital locked in open positions awaiting resolution.",
    "SELF-HEALING UPGRADE (2026-02-21): Monitor can now diagnose and fix strategic issues, not just tracebacks. Safe fixes: price zone filters, missing safety checks. Always test before restart, revert if tests fail.",
    "DIP_BUY also received price zone filter (0.55-0.65, 0.80-0.95) alongside VOLUME_SURGE fix. Both strategies now restricted to empirically profitable entry zones.",
    "VOLUME_SURGE self-heal FAILED first attempt: Edge zone filter worked but strategy had deeper logic issue — repeated re-entry after stop losses. Circuit breaker was missing.",
    "CODE FIX (2026-02-21 09:00): All 5 monitor-identified issues resolved: circuit breaker extended to DIP_BUY/VOLUME_SURGE/MID_RANGE, VOLUME_SURGE news gate fixed (requires matching direction), MID_RANGE edge zone filter added (per-side validation), stop_tracker persisted to disk (survives restarts), all processes restarted with new code. 775 tests passing.",
    "Circuit breaker now covers: MARKET_MAKER, DIP_BUY, VOLUME_SURGE, MID_RANGE. After 1 stop: AI re-entry screening. After 2 stops in 24h: hard block. MEAN_REVERSION has own 48h cooldown.",
    "stop_tracker renamed from mm_stop_tracker and saved to sovereign_hive/data/stop_tracker.json. Persisted on every stop, loaded on startup. Survives process restarts.",
    "MARKET_MAKER explosive growth (run #21): 68 new trades completed between runs #20-21, all profitable. Went from 15 trades/+$23.90 to 83 trades/+$1,043.95. Strategy dominates portfolio.",
    "DIP_BUY volatile: oscillates between positive and negative P&L. Went +$8.63 (run #21) back to -$9.73 (run #22). 49 trades, 36.7% WR. Marginally profitable at best.",
    "VOLUME_SURGE post-heal: effectively self-capped at $211.31 balance with $26 available, below $50 min position. Cannot enter new trades without existing positions resolving first.",
    "DIP_BUY sustained decline: 3 consecutive losses runs #25-26 (P&L: -$9.73 → -$16.18 → -$26.56). 51 trades, 35.3% WR. Edge zone filter may not be sufficient for this strategy's directional approach.",

    "DAILY ANALYSIS #2 (2026-02-22): DIP_BUY traded 77% in penny stocks (<$0.10), mostly 'US strikes Iran' markets — gambling on geopolitical noise, not data-driven edge. 34 stop losses vs 18 take profits. Edge zone filter NOT working for DIP_BUY because penny prices bypass the filter entirely.",
    "DAILY ANALYSIS #2: VOLUME_SURGE lost $148.91 on a SINGLE market (Bitcoin $68K, 8 trades). 56% of entries in low price zone (0.10-0.35) which has unknown Kelly. Crypto markets = negative edge per Becker data. Strategy violated both price zone AND category rules.",

    "DAILY ANALYSIS #2: CODE BUG FOUND — DIP_BUY uses abs(price_change) as Kelly expected_return. If price dropped 5%, Kelly calculates as if 5% guaranteed return. This inflates position sizes on penny stocks, causing outsized losses.",
    "DAILY ANALYSIS #2: NEAR_CERTAIN has $580 locked in 4 positions including 'BTC above $64K' and '$66K' on Feb 20 — these markets should have RESOLVED by now (Feb 22). Either resolution is delayed or positions are stuck.",

    "DAILY ANALYSIS #2: DIP_BUY open positions include FURIA vs TheMongolz @ $0.001 (167K shares, $168 cost) and Clippers vs Lakers @ $0.001 (77K shares, $77 cost) — these are effectively penny-stock gambling with massive share counts.",
