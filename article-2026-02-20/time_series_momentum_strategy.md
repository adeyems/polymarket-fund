A 23-page research paper reveals the number 1 method Hedge Funds use to beat the market:

Time Series Momentum

This is how: 🧵

1. What Is Time Series Momentum?

Time Series Momentum (TSMOM) bets on trends continuing. If a stock’s up, buy more; if down, sell. A 2011 study of 58 assets proved it works!

2. The Data Behind the Strategy

The TSMOM paper analyzed equities, currencies & more. T-stats showed consistent profits across 1-month lookbacks!

3. Coding TSMOM with Python

Code TSMOM in Python: 
- Use yfinance to get data
- Then momentum = price[-1] / price[-20] - 1. 

Positive? Buy
Negative? Sell

4. Real-World Performance

TSMOM outperforms passive investing. 

We're using a modified version of TSMOM in our Hedge Fund. 

One backtest shows 3500% return vs 450% S&P500. We are using TSMOM in our hedge fund. 

And we'd like to share exactly how it works.
