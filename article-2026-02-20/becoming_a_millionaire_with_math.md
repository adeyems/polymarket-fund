Edward Thorp, a mathematician and MIT professor, is renowned for devising the card counting algorithm for the game of 21, also known as blackjack. Utilizing this ingenious strategy, numerous casino players amassed millions of dollars in blackjack winnings. The algorithm's profound impact on the game prompted casinos to outlaw its use. In this thread, we delve into the intricacies of this groundbreaking algorithm.

Blackjack is a two-player card game where you aim to achieve a hand value closer to 21 than the dealer (casino).

At the beginning of this game, you determine the bet or the amount you wish to gamble. Then, the dealer deals two cards to you and two cards to themselves. You can see both of your cards, but only one of the dealer's cards is visible. After seeing the dealer's card, you can add cards to your hand as much as you want. Then, the dealer reveals their hand. If the dealer's score is less than 16, they add another card to their hand. Ultimately, the winner of the game is determined as follows:

* If your score exceeds 21, you lose the game.
* If the dealer's score exceeds 21, you win the game.
* Otherwise, if your score is higher than the dealer's score, you win; otherwise, you lose.

If you win, you receive money equal to your bet; otherwise, you lose the same amount of money.

Players' scores are calculated as follows:

* Each card from 2 to 9 carries points equal to its face value.
* Cards 10, Jack, Queen, and King are worth 10 points each.
* An Ace can be worth either 1 or 11 points, whichever benefits the player.

A player's score is the total sum of points from their cards.

In the card counting algorithm, you start with a count of 0. Each time you see a card from 2 to 6, you increase the count by one. Each time you see a 10, Jack, Queen, King, or Ace, you decrease the count by one.

When the count is high, it means that the unseen cards have higher values. When the count is low or negative, it indicates that the remaining cards have lower point values. With this information, you can decide how many cards to add to your hand.

It has been shown that using the card counting algorithm, you can play in a way that increases your winning probability to more than 51%. Although a one percent increase in winning odds may not seem significant, after playing 200 times, you can turn your initial $20,000 into over a million dollars.

This has led many participants to adopt the card counting algorithm, prompting casinos to eventually ban its use.

The films "21" and "The Last Casino" are based on stories about the card counting algorithm.
